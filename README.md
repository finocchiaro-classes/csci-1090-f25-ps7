# Problem Set 8

You will be doing your work in a Colab notebook. 

1. Follow [this link to the Colab notebook for PS8](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ps9pyjmqyOowiCHsN5SelpUo7KahfXsE?usp=sharing). Then make your own copy, as described in the notebook.
2. You will edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.
3. You will share the notebook with the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
4. You will download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you have done for previous problem sets.
5. You will *not* alter the Colab notebook after the deadline. If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late.

Don't forget that there is helpful code in [the sample code repo](https://github.com/CSCI1090-F24/sample_code/).


**Remember** You should write comments wherever you come up with some clever code of your own that would not be covered by the comments I have provided.

**Remember** Now at the top of every file, you will include your honor pledge. I'll give you a space in the Colab notebook for you to write your pledge.

## Deliverables

This problem set is due **Tuesday, November 5 at 11:59pm EST**. Remember this is how you submit:

1. Share your Colab notebook with me the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
2. Download the notebook to your computer, move it to this repository, and add, commit, and push it, just as you did for Python files in your previous problem sets.
