# Problem Set 7

You will be doing your work in a Colab notebook. This problem set is due **Wednesday, November 12 at 11:59pm EST**. 

1. You will edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.
2. You will add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you have done for previous problem sets.


Don't forget that there is helpful code in [the sample code repo](https://github.com/CSCI1090-F24/sample_code/).


**Remember** You should write comments wherever you come up with some clever code of your own that would not be covered by the comments I have provided.

**Remember** Now at the top of every file, you will include your honor pledge. I'll give you a space in the Colab notebook for you to write your pledge.
